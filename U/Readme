Attacks have been published that are computationally faster than a full brute-force attack, though none as of 2013 are computationally feasible.[1] For AES-128, the key can be recovered with a computational complexity of 2(126.1) using the biclique attack. For biclique attacks on AES-192 and AES-256, the computational complexities of 2(189.7) and 2(254.4) respectively apply. Related-key attacks can break AES-192 and AES-256 with complexities 2(176) and 2(99.5) in both time and data, respectively.[2
